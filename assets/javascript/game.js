// BEFORE GAME STARTS:
    // GENERATE STARTING RANDOM NUMBER FOR USER (BETWEEN 19-120)
    // ASSIGN EACH CRYSTAL A RANDOM VALUE (BETWEEN 1-12) AND KEEP HIDDEN FROM PLAYER
    // PLAYER TOTAL SCORE START AT 0
    // WINS START AT 0
    // LOSSES START AT 0

// ONCE GAME STARTS:
    // ADD "ON-CLICK" FUNCTION TO EACH CRYSTAL
        // WHEN FIRST CRYSTAL IS CLICKED:
            // GRAB VALUE FROM CRYSTAL
            // MAKE THIS VALUE THE USER TOTAL SCORE

                    // RESET THE PLAYER TOTAL SCORE TO 0

        // GREATER THAN RANDOM NUMBER --> USER LOSES
            // INCREMENT LOSSES BY 1
            // ALERT USER THEY LOST & UPDATE LOSSES IN DOM
                // RESET THE GAME AFTER PLAYER LOSES:
                    // REGENERATE A NEW STARTING RANDOM NUMBER FOR USER (BETWEEN 19-120)
